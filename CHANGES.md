# 4.0.0

- Breaking change: Rename `getFormatter` to `namespacer`.
- Breaking change: Rename `langs` to `languages`
- Breaking change: Remove `callback` (return a `Promise` instead
    from `IMF.load()` or `imf`); no longer allow loading from constructor;
   the promise also returns results on object rather than array.
- Breaking change: Require `languages`, `fallbackLanguages`, and `namespace`
    on `IMF.load()` or `imf` instead of `IMF()`.
- Breaking change: Remove `cb` option for `loadLocales` (returns Promise only)
- Breaking change: For `loadLocales`, add `langauges` to `langs` rather than
    replacing them.
- Breaking change: Moved file to `dist`.
- Breaking change: Throw in namespacer function if no message and no fallback
    locales are present
- Breaking change: Throw if no `key` argument is given to a namespacer function
- Breaking fix: In namespacer function, any detected fallback messages will be
    processed by `IntlMessageFormat` as well.
- Enhancement: Dynamically load plural/parent locale rules (unless
    `avoidRuleLoading` supplied) and cache
- Enhancement: Expose `intlMessageFormat` instance as property
- Enhancement: Expose a `fallbackLanguages` method
- Fix: From `loadLocales` return `this.locales`/`this.fallbackLocales`
    instead of the just recently retrieved ones (as all can apply)
- Docs: Demonstrate with `Promise` (`await`); use `_` more prominently in demos

# 3.0.1

- Fix: Browser build was not using browse-only modules
- npm: Update devDeps

# 3.0.0

- Build breaking change: Move builds to `dist`
- Build enhancement: Add ES6 module build
- Fix: Eliminate remaining global for pseudo-polyfill (`IntlMessageFormat`)
- npm: Update packaging files
- npm: Update simple-get-json and devDeps
- Testing: Make tests more cross-browser

# 2.1.1

- License: Rename LICENSE to LICENSE-MIT.txt
- npm: Update dep

# 2.1.0

- npm: Bump simple-get-json version
- npm: Update devDeps
- npm: Switch to babel-preset-env
- Build: Add Yarn lock

# 2.0.0

- Refactoring: Switch to ES6 Modules, arrow functions, etc. in source and tests
- npm: Add `browser` and `module` in `package.json` (and change `main`)
- Build: Node support
- Build: Have ES6 polyglot file support Node as well as browser (can rollup
    non-polyglot now as ES for browser without extra polyfill but have Rollup
    include `IntlMessageFormat` polyfill in `main` and `browser` builds in
    case needed in browser too (can still make a build based off `index-es6.js`
    without it)

# 1.0.2

- Properly ensure publishing current tagged version

# 1.0.0

- Switch to npm over bower

# 0.9.0

- Critical fix to message finding

# 0.8.0

- Change `fallbackLocale` property to `fallbackLocales` array. New
    property defaults to an empty array and is populated if
    `fallbackLanguages` is provided. All locales will be checked
    if `getFormatter` does not find a message within the `locales` property.

- Allow `fallbackLanguages` option to add results to `fallbackLocales`
    property even if no `callback` or `languages` option is provided
    upon instantiation.

- Supply retrieved `fallbackLocales` to be passed to the `callback` option
    as a fourth argument.

- Fix `callback` to be invoked on the IMF object (allowing it
    to access properties such as `locales`).

- Change default behavior of `getFormatter()` to utilize fallbacks
    unless the fourth `fallback` argument is explicitly set to `false`.

- Add `langs` option so that if `locales` are set without
    `languages` having been provided, corresponding language
    codes can be provided in error messages.

# 0.7.0

- Allow `locales` property to be set as an option at instantiation
    and added to by `loadLocales`.

# 0.6.0

- Add property `fallbackLanguages` and utilize in error messages

- Avoid setting `langs` property for fallback language (for
      `loadLocales` calls with `avoidSettingLocales` set to true)

# 0.5.0

- Cache Array.isArray, Allow array as ns+key argument or as
    separator-separated string

# 0.4.0

- Allow `fallback` to be a boolean instead of only a callback;
    will return message of the `fallbackLocale` (as may be determined
    by`fallbackLanguages`).

# 0.3.0

- Rename `fallbackLanguage` to `fallbackLanguages` for accuracy
    and parity with `languages`

# 0.2.0

- Allow formatter function to be supplied arguments as an object

- Add a `fallback` callback argument to the formatter function which,
    whenever a message cannot be found for `languages`, will be supplied
    a single object argument with properties, `message`, `langs`,
    `namespace`, `separator`, `key`, `values`, and `formats` and whose
    return value will be used for the return value of the formatter
    function. Note that `message` will contain the value for the message
    of the `fallbackLanguages` locale if `fallbackLanguage` (or
    `fallbackLocales`) had been supplied.

# 0.1.2

- Avoid bundling intl-messageformat dependency

# 0.1.1

- Bug: Avoid double-addition of separator for arrays
